          Write the differences among .forEach(), .map(), .filter() & find() :-
        </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl text-white mx-10 my-5">
          map() creates a new array from calling a function for every array
          element.We can use it instead of manual for loop iteration.It calls
          the function for each elements it does not iterate an empty array.It
          does not change the original array <br />
          .filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a
          certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return
          truthy for the criteria.This method checks the given values existence
          when values are exists it return a new array consisting of our certain
          value <br />
          .forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an
          array but does not change the array and it returns undefined. Instead
          of manual for loop iteration we can use it. It can not iterate an
          empty array .It it called the callback function once time for each
          elements <br />
          The find() method returns the first element in an array that passes a
          test function. It executes the callback function for each element in
          the array until the callback returns a truthy value. If the callback
          returns a truthy value, the find() immediately returns the element and
          stops searching. Otherwise, it returns undefined.

          Write the differences among Local Storage , Session Storage & Cookie?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl text-white mx-10 my-5">
          Local storage: We can store data as key/value pairs in a web browser
          using the local storage web storage technique on the client's
          computer.This data persists even if the user closes the browser, shuts
          down their computer, or restarts their browser. <br />
          We can use the setItem() method to set the data in local storage. This
          method takes two parameters, key and value. With this method, we can
          store value with a key. localStorage.setItem(key, value); We can
          retrieve the data stored in it, we can use the getItem() method. This
          method takes only one parameter, the key whose value we need to
          access. localStorage.getItem(key); We can remove the data with the
          help of the removeItem() method, which is stored in memory about the
          key. localStorage.removeItem(key);
          <br />
          Session Storage: Session storage is similar to local storage, but the
          data stored in session storage is only available during the current
          browser session. The data is stored in key-value pairs and can be
          accessed using JavaScript. Once the browser window is closed, the data
          is automatically deleted. Session storage can be useful for storing
          temporary data that is only needed for a single browsing session.
          <br />
          Cookies: Cookies are small text files that are stored on a user's
          browser by websites. Cookies can store user preferences, login
          information, and other data that can be used to enhance the user
          experience. Unlike local storage and session storage, cookies are sent
          to the server with every HTTP request, which can make them slower to
          retrieve. Cookies can also be set to expire after a certain amount of
          time.

          What is JS event loop and how it works?
        </h1>
        <p class="text-2xl text-white mx-10 my-5">
          The JavaScript event loop is a fancy way for JavaScript to handle
          tasks that take a while to complete. When we run JavaScript, it can
          only do one thing at a time. But sometimes we need to wait for things
          like data from the server or user input. If we waited for these things
          before running the next line of code, our app would freeze up. So
          instead of waiting, JavaScript uses an event-driven system that goes
          through a queue of tasks. When one task is done, its corresponding
          function is added to a stack of things to do. If that function
          generates more tasks, they are added to the queue too. This keeps
          going forever, so JavaScript can handle long-winded tasks without
          holding up the whole app.

        <p class="text-2xl text-white mx-10 my-5">
          quizTimer function count the time during the submission of quiz.When
          we click the start quiz button the time counter function began it
          works.It shows the time we spend to submit the quizzes.It is good to
          submit the answers within short time. It count our individual submit
          time and later shows it when we retrieve the data from local storage.

        <p class="text-2xl text-white mx-10 my-5">
          The chooseQuiz function gives us the facility to choose the answers
          from the option.It sent the given answer to the source where correct
          answers is stored.It takes our answers and sent it to displayAnswers
          function by calling it .So, we can also say that chooseQuiz also shows
          the result of ours in UI.
